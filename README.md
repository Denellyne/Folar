## About Folar

#### Folar is a statically typed compiled language that aims to eliminate errors about const correctness that are often the bane of C/C++ by making everything const by default whilst giving you the ability to do everything low-level like in C/C++

## Goals

#### Make a fast and lightweight compiler whilst using gcc as a linker for compatibility with libc 

#### Be an alternative to C/C++ without trading of speed

## About the project

#### In spite everything this isn't being made to be a replacement but a project from which I can learn more about compilers whilst achieving something actually useful in my day-to-day use
